During my internship at the Ministry of Commerce & Industry (MOC), Government of India, from June 1, 2023, to July 30, 2023, I worked on a project analyzing India-Australia trade data from 2016 to 2022, aimed at providing insights into trade trends and forecasting future volumes. I extracted trade data from the ITC Trade Map, focusing on India’s top 10 imports and exports with Australia and globally, calculating percentage shares and growth rates to understand trade patterns and assess India’s market presence in Australia. The project involved investigating Australia’s trade landscape, analyzing its primary trade inflows and outflows across nations, and comparing India’s trade performance with key Australian partners. I also developed a Linear Regression model in Python to forecast total trade volumes for 2023, identifying product-level trends to inform trade strategies and policy recommendations. This project offered valuable experience in data analysis, econometric modeling, and visualization, underscoring the importance of data-driven insights in shaping informed decision-making in international trade.
